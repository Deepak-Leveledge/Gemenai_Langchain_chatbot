🚀 Gemini LangChain Chatbot Project

✅ Live Demo: https://gemenai-langchain-chatbot.onrender.com/
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Chatbot Application built using LangChain, Google Gemini API, and Streamlit. It allows users to:

    Ask any question and receive responses from Gemini LLM.

    Adjust the temperature for response randomness.

    Track token usage and latency for each request.

    Clear the conversation using the Clear button.

✅ This project is designed to demonstrate LangChain's LLM capabilities using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model.

📚 Learning & Key Concepts Applied
✅ LangChain Integration

    Implemented LangChain to connect with Gemini LLM.

    Used ChatGoogleGenerativeAI model with API key authentication.

    Added temperature control for response randomness.

    Displayed token usage and latency in the UI.

✅ Streamlit App Development

    Created a simple, user-friendly interface with Streamlit.

    Added:

        Input box for user queries.

        Temperature slider for customization.

        Clear button for refreshing the interface.

    Included error handling for invalid API keys or empty responses.

✅ API Key Management

    Used .env file to securely store and load the Gemini API key.

    Ensured environment variables were properly loaded during deployment on Render.

✅ Deployment on Render

    Hosted the project on Render for free public access.

    Managed environment variables in Render's dashboard.

    Fixed issues like:
